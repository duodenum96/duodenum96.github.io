I am Yasir Çatal. I am a PhD candidate in neuroscience at the University of Ottawa, under supervision of [Georg Northoff](https://www.georgnorthoff.com/). I am studying intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), in particular, how they can be a bridge between rest and task states. I am also the author of the software package [IntrinsicTimescales.jl](https://github.com/duodenum96/IntrinsicTimescales.jl), designed to compute INTs in an easy-to-use way. 

I live either in Ottawa, Canada or Istanbul, Turkey with my wife and two cats Nohut and Mercimek.
