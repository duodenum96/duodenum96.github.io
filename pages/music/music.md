Post-metal with my friend Burak Bostancıoğlu on bass. This was super fun to make. The production is a bit rough, all of it is DIY. But the songs here are the most mature stuff I've written. 

## Dog in the Burning House

Instrumental stuff that I've wrote years ago, sounds terrible but I'll always have a soft spot for it. I can't play these songs anymore and have no idea how I wrote them. Feels like a completely different time. I've been working on new stuff under the same name very, very slowly, since 2020, will update here when I'm done.
